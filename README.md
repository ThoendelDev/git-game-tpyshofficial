Congratulations, it looks like you found the "bug."
When you work with other programmers on the same project, bugs are bound to appear.
One way to create bugs is by changing code that you did not write without understanding what the code is doing.

``Level 3``

Sometimes we like to blame others for introducing bugs in our code. 
Think you can find out who introduced a bug into our file cool.cpp? 
We think he had something to do with the development of git.
And from what we hear he also made a branch under his name.
Checkout to that branch after you find out who the culprit is.
