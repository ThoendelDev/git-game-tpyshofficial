Welcome to the "tree" branch. Looks like good ol' 
Linus modified the "nextclue_input.cpp" file. Normally,
when ran with the executable "outputclue", the
"nextclue_input.cpp" file would give us the next hint.

Maybe, you should try running the executable with the
"nextclue_input.cpp" file and see what happens...
