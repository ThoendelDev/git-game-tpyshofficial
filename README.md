``Level 8``

Looks like you resolved your conflict and found our branch, congrats!! 

Hmm...it seems this branch has a file that was seen before in another branch. 
Do you "remember" what it is?
I think this file has something to do with the next clue, but it seems to be very ugly looking. 
Maybe if we compare the "diff"erences between this file and the file from before we'll know where to go next...
